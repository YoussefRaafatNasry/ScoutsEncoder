## Tips and Tricks

1. Use the clipboard buttons _(i.e. cut, copy, paste and clear buttons)_ while copying or pasting any text to make sure that all text is copied or pasted without any loss of data.
1. Make sure that when you copy the Encoded Text to any text editor that it matches the Text in the output textbox; as some text editors that don’t support arabic or right-to-left typing invert the text or mess it up.
1. We recommend using [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com) as your text editor. Align paragraph to right and set text direction to right-to-left.
